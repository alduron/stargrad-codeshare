	// Everything up to this point was standard replication stuff for replicating objects in C++ only. However, since you want to work primarily in blueprints
	// some additional code can be setup to allow any child of the SGReplicatedObject class to be replicated entirely in blueprints.
	// The first part of this is creating an array of all the subobjects we want to replicate.
	// THE OBJECTS IN THIS ARRAY SHOULD ONLY BE SUBOBJECTS OF THIS OBJECT!!!
	// You will be able to add and remove objects from this list entirely in blueprints.

	// To get any given object, or object list, to replicate, you must have the object, or object list, set to replicate in blueprints,
	// then add it to the SubobjectsToReplicate array. Note: This will only work with objects derived from this class.
	// This will allow you to have multiple levels of object replication. Subobjects replicating subobjects replicating subobjects etc.
	// If a given instance of this class doesn't need to replicate any subobjects, then don't add any to the SubobjectsToReplicate list.

	// The second part is the ReplicateSubobjects function where we replicate all the objects in the above list.



// The functions below are uneeded and can be deleted. Don't worry they will still work in Blueprints. Remember to delete from the .cpp as well.
