	// IE. Sending a notification to a child object to also get destroyed because this is being destroyed.
	// Warning: It is not good practice to alert external classes about this object's destruction from here. Use the OnDestroyed Event for that instead.
	// IE. The player has a list of these objects and this one will get deleted.
	//     IT IS NOT this object's responsibility to clean up its information in the player's list.
	//     This goes against OOP principles pretty heavily.
	//     Use the OnDestroyed event for that instead.
	//     When the player adds this object to the list it also subcribes to the event,
	//     then the event will be triggered and the player class can deal with its own clean up as it sees fit.
